Workplan

Week 6 (in order of importance):

1. Data preprocessing (Prayla, Derby, Sjoerd)
2. Model architecture (Karen, Michael)
3. First training 
4. Visualization draft (with first trained model?)

Week 7 (in order of importance):

1. Model building/parameter finetuning (finsih CNN model)
2. Proper visualization
3. Making a short presentation

Week 8:

1. Start CNN-LSTM model
2. Aim to finish CNN-LSTM model
3. Start report

Week 9:

1. Work on models and report, and do what you can in regard to their being an exam

Week 10:

1. Finish and present

---------------------------------------------------------------------
ToDo's:

- Include velocity data as input on the CNN multi-output model (Derby)
- Apply data-augmentation on the inputs on the CNN multi-output model (Michael)
- Tweaking hyperparameters for the CNN multi-output model (Prayla)
- Work on the CNN auto-regressive model (Karen)
- Build a CNN-LSTM model (Sjoerd)

Later on ToDo's:

- Include velocity data as input on the CNN auto-regressive model 
- Apply data-augmentation on the inputs on the CNN auto-regressive model
- Tweaking hyperparameters for the CNN auto-regressive model
- Combine results into a presentation
